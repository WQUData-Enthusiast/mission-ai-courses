    "- No spaces in the name\n",
    "- Cannot be identical to reserved words in Python like `str`, `print`, etc. If there is a logical name for your variable and it conflicts with a Python reserved keyword, then use a single trailing underscore: `var_`\n",

    "> **It is not weakly-typed, as that would mean that the same memory block is being re-interpreted in a different way. Strong typing means that once assigned a value of a particular kind, objects obey strict rules about how they can interact with other objects of various types. Weak typing means that such rules are more relaxed. This doesn't mean that strongly typed languages are necessarily superior in any way; it's just a language design choice.  1 + \"1\" = error. The address changes when you assign some new value to a variable, because other than list/dict/set, all other object types are immutable. So you aren't changing the vaue as much as creating a new variable** \n",
