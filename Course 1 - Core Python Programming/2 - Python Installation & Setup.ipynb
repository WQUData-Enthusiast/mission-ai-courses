Whenever you type any command in the terminal, or when one program calls another without its whole path, the OS first tries to find the command definition in the current working directory, and then in all the paths mentioned in PATH variable.\n",
    ">- In Windows, navigate to \"Environment Variables\" in system settings and locate the \"Path\" environment variable. It should contain the Python Application path and the Python Scripts path. \n",
    ">- If it hasn't been set already, you can also add Python to your path manually. Navigate to \"Environment Variables\" in system settings and locate the \"Path\" environment variable (create it if it doesn't exist). You will need to add 2 folders to the \"Path\" variable: The Python application path, which is the folder where you originally installed Python; and The Python Scripts path. The Scripts folder should be located within the Python application path. Add the complete paths, and make sure you add semi-colons as separators.\n",
    ">- In Mac and Linux, add the Python directory (/usr/local/bin/python) to the PATH environment variable in the ksh or bash shell\t\t"
